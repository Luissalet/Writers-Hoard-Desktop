# VVD catalogue cross-reference (Agora 1095, continuation of 1041)

## Why this exists

The 148-row inventory of task 1041 has no row for VVD's map editor (its M rows are
the 3D model viewer) and no rows for whole areas: Campaign, Compendium, Name
generator, Soundscape, Animator, Annotator, Cartographer, To-do list. This pass
starts from VVD's own shipped interface catalogue instead of from screenshots.

## Method and evidence levels

1. Source catalogue: the English interface strings VVD serves to the
   authenticated editor (`/i18n/en.<hash>.json`, 21,286 keys, read 21-10-2026).
   They are the list of controls and options the product exposes. They are not
   proof of behaviour; where a row infers behaviour from a label it says so.
   The raw file is third-party data and is not stored in this repository.
2. Authenticated observation (21-10-2026): Map Beta 0.1.58 in the tool preview
   of the reference session — starters (blank sea/land, size presets, templates
   including the Roman Mediterranean), biome palette, elevation, rivers, paths,
   places, zones, labels, settings, look selector. Luis's video of 20-10
   (12.45 s, VVD promotional reel) shows the biome brush on a tablet, a painted
   regional map with pins, Quill's 3D book, the 3D tilt and a relation tree.
3. Writer side: six independent read-only agents opened Writer's source for
   every offline capability and classified it PRESENT / PARTIAL / ABSENT with
   file evidence. This is source reading, not execution. A PRESENT here is not a
   tested workflow; a PARTIAL names the concrete difference.

| Area | File | Rows | Present | Partial | Absent | Online |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Map authoring (atlasTool) | A1-atlas-authoring.md | 75 | 17 | 31 | 24 | 2 |
| Map lenses: travel, trade, campaign, image maps | A2-atlas-lenses.md | 66 | 10 | 25 | 25 | 6 |
| Campaign manager | B-campaign.md | 82 | 4 | 46 | 16 | 17 |
| Writing, timeline, trees, tables, codex | C-writing.md | 113 | 39 | 48 | 21 | 5 |
| Smaller tools | D1-tools.md | 69 | 20 | 25 | 17 | 12 |
| Platform surfaces | D2-platform.md | 88 | 20 | 40 | 12 | 16 |

Counts are grep counts over each table (a row may mention two statuses). They
are a work list, not a parity score. Each file ends with ranked offline gaps,
implementation sketches, risks and UNKNOWN items.

## Delivery waves

Wave 1, maps (Luis's priority): saved look per world; blank sea/land starters;
area measurement and reference-outline scale; hand-placeable stamp library;
travel profile (ways, pace, ground costs, day hours) with MCP planner; label
handles; map versions linked to timeline events with playback.
Later waves follow the ranked lists of the other areas. Every delivery keeps
existing capabilities and is proved through UI, MCP, persistence/reopen and
export where relevant, then independently reviewed.
