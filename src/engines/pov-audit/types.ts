// POV / Scene Audit — derived view types
// ============================================
//
// POV Audit is a "compute-only" engine — it doesn't own any Dexie tables.
// It derives summaries from existing `scenes`, `sceneCasts`, `dialogBlocks`,
// and `codexEntries` (characters) tables.
//
// The shape below is the single row of the audit grid. One row per character.
